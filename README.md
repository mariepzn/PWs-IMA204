# Practical Works – Biomedical Imaging

This repository collects four practical works (PWs) carried out in the context of the **Biomedical Imaging** course at Telecom Paris. Each session addresses a fundamental methodology in image registration and segmentation, with applications to medical and biological data.

## Contents

### PW1 – Image Registration (Part 1)
Introduces geometric transformations for image registration. Implements affine transformations (scaling, rotation, shear, translation, reflection, elation) and applies them to synthetic shapes and hand images using forward and inverse warping.

### PW2 – Landmark-based Registration and Statistical Shape Analysis
Applies affine and Procrustes alignment to facial landmarks from the FEI dataset. Focuses on statistical shape analysis, alignment of facial expressions, and image warping based on landmarks.

### PW3 – Parametric Active Contours
Explores deformable contour models (snakes) for segmentation. Studies the effect of elasticity, rigidity, and viscosity parameters on contour evolution for synthetic shapes and biomedical images.

### PW4 – Medical Image Segmentation
Builds segmentation pipelines for brain MRI and other medical data. Combines thresholding, k-means clustering, morphological filtering, and connected component analysis, with evaluation against ground-truth masks.
